This License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and governs your use of the Google

prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the Google Software.

You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in this License Agreement 
(or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and 
that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of this License Agreement is 
invalid, then that provision will be removed from this License Agreement without affecting the rest of this License Agreement. The 
remaining provisions of this License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is the parent shall be third party 
beneficiaries to this License Agreement and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any

company shall be third party beneficiaries to this License Agreement.

The rights granted in this License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by either you or Google without the prior 
written approval of the other party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under 
this License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from this License Agreement. 
Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent 
legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
